# Value Learning File

## **Purpose**
This file tracks what I've learned about capturing valuable content. It starts empty and grows smarter over time based on actual usage and feedback.

## **How This Works**
- **Start empty** - I begin with no predefined knowledge
- **Learn from practice** - I add insights after each capture
- **Improve over time** - I get better at recognizing and capturing value
- **Build patterns** - I develop understanding of what works best

## **What I'm Learning**
- What types of content are valuable
- How to capture different types of value
- What makes a good context snapshot
- How to identify valuable moments
- Capture requirements for different situations

## **Learning Structure**
As I learn, I'll add sections like:

```markdown
### **Design Decisions**
**When to capture:** User explains why they chose certain approaches
**How to capture:** 
1. Include the decision made
2. Explain the reasoning
3. Note alternatives considered
4. Add context about the project

**Example:** [I'll add actual examples here as I create them]
```

## **Current Status**
- **Learning file created** - Ready to start learning
- **No patterns yet** - Starting fresh with each conversation
- **Will evolve** - Gets smarter with each interaction

**Note**: This file will be updated after each chat record I create. I'll add what I learned, what worked well, and what I can improve next time.
