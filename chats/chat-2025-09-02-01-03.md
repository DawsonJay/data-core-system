# Chat Session Report - 2025-09-02 01:03

## Summary
Value-extracted conversation covering: I think this is important: We need to redesign the save chat process to work with Natural Value Extraction instead of memory files.; I decided to implement a hybrid approach where the AI creates comprehensive chat records and the Python script handles deduplication while preserving narrative flow.. Total insights: 685 characters with natural value recognition.

## Key Insights
I think this is important: We need to redesign the save chat process to work with Natural Value Extraction instead of memory files..

## Decisions Made
