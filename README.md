# Data Core System

## Purpose
This system exists to perfectly preserve and protect irreplaceable development data and professional journey information. Every piece of information, every decision, every learning moment is safeguarded through immutable storage, comprehensive backup strategies, and continuous health monitoring. The data-core is a universal tool for any domain where data preservation and protection matter.

## Core Rules (Immutable Laws)
- **Data Immutability:** Once saved, data can NEVER be modified or deleted
- **Zero Information Loss:** Every piece of information is preserved forever
- **Complete History:** Every decision, mistake, and success is recorded
- **No Overwriting:** New information creates new records, never replaces old ones
- **File Protection:** Files can NEVER be modified or deleted once created
- **Mandatory Backup Before Commit:** All Git commits MUST be preceded by comprehensive backups
- **Time Verification:** Always verify correct GMT time before recording timestamps
- **GMT Timezone Only:** Use only GMT/UTC timezone to avoid regional/VPN issues

## System Philosophy
- **Capture everything - don't filter for perceived value** - comprehensive data capture without premature judgment
- **Record raw information without premature analysis** - preserve information in its original form
- **Let future analysis determine what's valuable** - don't make assumptions about what will be important later
- **Focus on data preservation, not data interpretation** - our job is to protect data, not analyze it
- **Protect irreplaceable data** - data safety is paramount
- **Monitor system health** - continuous validation and integrity checking
- **Timestamp everything** - maintain chronological accuracy
- **Use descriptive, searchable names** - ensure data discoverability
- **Build incrementally** - only add what's actually needed
- **Multiple backup strategies** - redundancy at every level
- **Data protection first** - always backup before any changes or commits
- **Backup-first Git operations** - never commit without comprehensive backup verification
- **Proactive monitoring** - detect problems before they cause data loss
- **Data is sacred** - irreplaceable information requires maximum protection

## System Structure
- `chats/` - Chat reports using Chat Report Framework
- `processes/` - Process scripts that enforce rules and frameworks
- **Planned data folders:**
  - `projects/` - Technical project reports and work records
  - `interviews/` - Interview records and feedback
  - `journal/` - Personal reflections and learning moments
  - `documents/` - Photocopies, screenshots, certificates
  - `stories/` - Work anecdotes and professional experiences
  - `learning/` - Course records and skill development
  - `research/` - Technical research and industry analysis
- Additional folders will be added as needed

**IMPORTANT: Before working with any folder or its contents, you MUST read that folder's README.md to understand the specific rules and standards for that data type.**

## How to Use the System

### Getting Started
1. **Read this master README** to understand the system
2. **Read the relevant folder README** before working with any data type
3. **Use the master script** to perform operations: `python data_core.py save chat`

### Master Script Commands
- **Save chat report:** `python data_core.py save chat`
- **Commit with data protection:** `python data_core.py commit "live conversation context"`
- **Additional commands** will be added as new data types are implemented

### Workflow
1. **Plan your data** - decide what type of information you want to capture
2. **Read folder README** - understand the rules for that data type
3. **Run master script** - use the appropriate command to create/access data
4. **Follow frameworks** - ensure your data follows established patterns
5. **Validate results** - check that the operation completed successfully
6. **Commit with protection** - use `python data_core.py commit` for safe version control

## Process System Details
- **Rule Enforcement:** All data operations go through process scripts that enforce rules
- **Verbose Output:** Every process provides step-by-step logging and status updates
- **Framework Compliance:** Processes validate data against established frameworks
- **Error Prevention:** Automated validation prevents rule violations and data corruption
- **Unified Interface:** Master script (`data_core.py`) coordinates all operations
- **Process Standards:** See `processes/README.md` for detailed rules and patterns

## Data Protection & Health Monitoring
- **Irreplaceable Data:** All stored information is irreplaceable and requires maximum protection
- **Multiple Backup Strategies:** Redundancy at every level to prevent data loss
- **Three-Tier Backup System:** Major/Standard/Minor backups based on change significance
  - **Major backups:** Significant structural changes, new data types, framework updates
  - **Standard backups:** Moderate feature changes, multiple file modifications
  - **Minor backups:** Routine updates, small fixes, every commit gets at least minor backup
  - **Retention policy:** Keep last 5 of each backup type on GitHub branches
- **Mandatory Pre-Commit Backup:** No Git commit allowed without successful backup creation
- **Backup Verification:** All backups verified before allowing commit to proceed
- **Chat-First Workflow:** Always save current conversation before any Git operations
- **Continuous Validation:** Automated checks ensure data integrity and framework compliance
- **Health Monitoring:** System continuously monitors file health and data quality
- **Early Warning Systems:** Detect potential problems before they cause data loss
- **Recovery Mechanisms:** Ability to restore from backups if issues are detected
- **Proactive Protection:** Prevent problems rather than just react to them

## File Protection & Finalization
- **During Setup:** Folders, files, and frameworks can be edited and tested
- **After Finalization:** Once a folder is marked as finalized, its contents become immutable
- **Folder Status:** Each folder's README contains a "finalized" flag
- **Data Immutability:** Finalized folders cannot have files modified or deleted
- **Development Flexibility:** Unfinalized folders allow iteration and improvement
- **Backup Strategy:** Multiple backup locations to prevent data loss
- **Validation:** Vigorous checks to ensure data integrity before saving

## Time & Timestamp Rules
- **GMT Only:** All timestamps must use GMT/UTC timezone
- **Time Verification:** Always verify correct time before recording
- **No Regional Time:** Avoid local time zones that can change with VPNs
- **Consistent Format:** Use ISO 8601 format for all timestamps

## Documentation Principles
- **No duplication between READMEs** - information exists in exactly one place
- **Master README coordinates** - provides system overview and universal rules
- **Child READMEs implement** - contain specific rules and detailed information
- **Cross-references guide** - master README points to where details live
- **Single source of truth** - each rule or requirement exists in only one README
