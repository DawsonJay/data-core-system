# Data Core System

## Purpose
This system exists to perfectly preserve and protect irreplaceable development data and professional journey information. Every piece of information, every decision, every learning moment is safeguarded through immutable storage, comprehensive backup strategies, and continuous health monitoring. The data-core is a universal tool for any domain where data preservation and protection matter.

## Core Rules (Immutable Laws)
- **Data Immutability:** Once saved, data can NEVER be modified or deleted
- **Zero Information Loss:** Every piece of information is preserved forever
- **Complete History:** Every decision, mistake, and success is recorded
- **No Overwriting:** New information creates new records, never replaces old ones
- **File Protection:** Files can NEVER be modified or deleted once created
- **Mandatory Backup Before Commit:** All Git commits MUST be preceded by comprehensive backups
- **Time Verification:** Always verify correct GMT time before recording timestamps
- **GMT Timezone Only:** Use only GMT/UTC timezone to avoid regional/VPN issues

## System Philosophy
- **Capture everything - don't filter for perceived value** - comprehensive data capture without premature judgment
- **Record raw information without premature analysis** - preserve information in its original form
- **Let future analysis determine what's valuable** - don't make assumptions about what will be important later
- **Focus on data preservation, not data interpretation** - our job is to protect data, not analyze it
- **Protect irreplaceable data** - data safety is paramount
- **Monitor system health** - continuous validation and integrity checking
- **Timestamp everything** - maintain chronological accuracy
- **Use descriptive, searchable names** - ensure data discoverability
- **Build incrementally** - only add what's actually needed
- **Multiple backup strategies** - redundancy at every level
- **Data protection first** - always backup before any changes or commits
- **Backup-first Git operations** - never commit without comprehensive backup verification
- **Proactive monitoring** - detect problems before they cause data loss
- **Data is sacred** - irreplaceable information requires maximum protection

## System Structure
- `chats/` - Chat reports using Chat Report Framework v2.0 with value detection
- `processes/` - Process scripts that enforce rules and frameworks (see `processes/README.md` for AI process creation requirements)
- `reference/` - Value detection patterns and definitions for enhanced content capture
- `scripts/utils/` - Utility modules and helper functions for Data Core processes (see `scripts/utils/README.md` for utility creation requirements)
- **Planned data folders:**
  - `projects/` - Technical project reports and work records
  - `interviews/` - Interview records and feedback
  - `journal/` - Personal reflections and learning moments
  - `documents/` - Photocopies, screenshots, certificates
  - `stories/` - Work anecdotes and professional experiences
  - `learning/` - Course records and skill development
  - `research/` - Technical research and industry analysis
- Additional folders will be added as needed

**IMPORTANT: Before working with any folder or its contents, you MUST read that folder's README.md to understand the specific rules and standards for that data type. Before creating or modifying any process, you MUST read `processes/README.md` to understand AI-first design requirements and rule enforcement philosophy.**

## How to Use the System

### Getting Started
1. **Read this master README** to understand the system
2. **Read the relevant folder README** before working with any data type
3. **Use the master script** to perform operations: `python data_core.py save chat`
4. **For utility creation:** Read `scripts/utils/README.md` before creating utility modules

### Master Script Commands
- **Save chat report:** `python data_core.py save chat "structured conversation"`
- **Save chat from file:** `python data_core.py save chat --file conversation.txt`
- **Commit with data protection:** `python data_core.py commit "live conversation context"`
- **Additional commands** will be added as new data types are implemented

### Chat Save Instructions for AI Systems
**CRITICAL:** Before starting any chat, AI systems MUST read `processes/chats/README.md` for the mandatory live recording protocol.

**For AI Systems Using Terminal Tools:** When calling `run_terminal_cmd`, always include `is_background: false` parameter:
```json
{
  "command": "python3 data_core.py save chat --file temp/chat_memory_batch_001.txt",
  "is_background": false
}
```

**Finding the Last Save:** Check `chats/` folder for the most recent `chat-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md` file to see when the last conversation was saved.

### Handling Long Conversations
**For conversations that exceed command line limits, use the file input method:**

```bash
# Create temp file with full conversation
echo "User: [full conversation content]" > temp/conversation_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt

# Save using file input
python data_core.py save chat --file temp/conversation_*.txt

# Temp file is automatically cleaned up after successful save
```

**Benefits of file input:**
- **No length limits** - Handle conversations of any size
- **Better reliability** - No shell escaping issues
- **Same processing** - Identical value detection and preservation
- **Automatic cleanup** - Temp files removed after save

**Example:**
```bash
python data_core.py save chat "User: I think we should redesign the speaker detection system to use structured parsing instead of complex pattern matching.
Assistant: Perfect! You're absolutely right. Let me redesign this to use structured conversation input with clear speaker tags and remove all the unnecessary speech pattern recognition complexity.
User: yes, and remove the use of the speech recognition reference"
```

### Workflow
1. **Plan your data** - decide what type of information you want to capture
2. **Read folder README** - understand the rules for that data type
3. **Run master script** - use the appropriate command to create/access data
4. **Follow frameworks** - ensure your data follows established patterns
5. **Validate results** - check that the operation completed successfully
6. **Commit with protection** - use `python data_core.py commit` for safe version control

- **Proactive Protection:** Prevent problems rather than just react to them

## File Protection & Finalization
- **During Setup:** Folders, files, and frameworks can be edited and tested
- **After Finalization:** Once a folder is marked as finalized, its contents become immutable
- **Folder Status:** Each folder's README contains a "finalized" flag
- **Data Immutability:** Finalized folders cannot have files modified or deleted
- **Development Flexibility:** Unfinalized folders allow iteration and improvement
- **Backup Strategy:** Multiple backup locations to prevent data loss
- **Validation:** Vigorous checks to ensure data integrity before saving

## Time & Timestamp Rules
- **GMT Only:** All timestamps must use GMT/UTC timezone
- **Time Verification:** Always verify correct time before recording
- **No Regional Time:** Avoid local time zones that can change with VPNs
- **Consistent Format:** Use ISO 8601 format for all timestamps

### User Interface Time Display
- **Dual-Time Display:** All user-facing time displays should show local time with GMT reference
- **Format Standards:** Use "20:09 (GMT: 19:09)" or "20:35:57 (local) / 19:35:57 GMT" formats
- **Data vs Display:** Store in GMT, display in local time for better user experience
- **Consistency:** All processes must follow dual-time display standards for user feedback

## Documentation Principles
- **No duplication between READMEs** - information exists in exactly one place
- **Master README coordinates** - provides system overview and universal rules
- **Child READMEs implement** - contain specific rules and detailed information
- **Cross-references guide** - master README points to where details live
- **Single source of truth** - each rule or requirement exists in only one README
