# Data Core System

## Purpose
This system exists to perfectly preserve and protect irreplaceable development data and professional journey information. Every piece of information, every decision, every learning moment is safeguarded through immutable storage, comprehensive backup strategies, and continuous health monitoring. The data-core is a universal tool for any domain where data preservation and protection matter.

## Core Rules (Immutable Laws)
- **Data Immutability:** Once saved, data can NEVER be modified or deleted
- **Zero Information Loss:** Every piece of information is preserved forever
- **Complete History:** Every decision, mistake, and success is recorded
- **No Overwriting:** New information creates new records, never replaces old ones
- **File Protection:** Files can NEVER be modified or deleted once created

- **Time Verification:** Always verify correct GMT time before recording timestamps
- **GMT Timezone Only:** Use only GMT/UTC timezone to avoid regional/VPN issues

## System Philosophy
- **Capture everything - don't filter for perceived value** - comprehensive data capture without premature judgment
- **Record raw information without premature analysis** - preserve information in its original form
- **Let future analysis determine what's valuable** - don't make assumptions about what will be important later
- **Focus on data preservation, not data interpretation** - our job is to protect data, not analyze it
- **Protect irreplaceable data** - data safety is paramount
- **Monitor system health** - continuous validation and integrity checking
- **Timestamp everything** - maintain chronological accuracy
- **Use descriptive, searchable names** - ensure data discoverability
- **Build incrementally** - only add what's actually needed
- **Multiple backup strategies** - redundancy at every level
- **Data protection first** - always backup before any changes or commits
- **Backup-first Git operations** - never commit without comprehensive backup verification
- **Proactive monitoring** - detect problems before they cause data loss
- **Data is sacred** - irreplaceable information requires maximum protection

**IMPORTANT: Before working with any folder or its contents, you MUST read that folder's README.md to understand the specific rules and standards for that data type. Before creating or modifying any process, you MUST read `processes/README.md` to understand AI-first design requirements and rule enforcement philosophy.**

## How to Use the System

### Getting Started
1. **Read this master README** to understand the system
2. **Read the relevant folder README** before working with any data type
3. **Use the master script** to perform operations: `python data_core.py save chat`
4. **For process creation:** Read `processes/README.md` before creating new processes

### Master Script Commands
- **Save chat report:** `python data_core.py save chat "structured conversation"`
- **Save chat from file:** `python data_core.py save chat --file conversation.txt`
- **Commit with data protection:** `python data_core.py commit "live conversation context"`
- **Additional commands** will be added as new data types are implemented

### Real-Time Value Capture System for AI
**CRITICAL:** AI systems now use the real-time value capture system defined in `MEMORY.md` and `chats/system/framework.md`.

**Real-Time Value Capture System:**
- **During conversation:** AI automatically identifies valuable content and creates chat records immediately
- **No save process needed:** AI creates `chat-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md` files directly when value is identified
- **Framework v3.0:** Simple three-section structure (Context, Insight, Technical) for immediate capture
- **Zero workflow disruption:** Natural conversation flow with autonomous value extraction
- **Learning system:** AI continuously improves capture quality through `chats/system/value_learning.md`
- **Gapless history:** Maintains complete conversation coverage through validation

**For AI Systems Using Terminal Tools:** When calling `run_terminal_cmd`, always include `is_background: false` parameter:
```json
{
  "command": "python3 data_core.py save chat",
  "is_background": false
}
```

**Finding Recent Captures:** Check `chats/` folder for the most recent `chat-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md` file to see when the last valuable content was captured.

**IMPORTANT - How the Real-Time Capture System Works:**
1. **AI identifies valuable content** during conversation using the framework in `MEMORY.md`
2. **AI creates chat record immediately:** Creates `chat-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md` file directly
3. **No save process needed** - AI captures value in real-time without delays
4. **Framework v3.0 structure** - Simple three-section format for immediate use
5. **Learning system updates** - AI improves capture quality through `value_learning.md`

**ðŸ“š COMPLETE GUIDE:** For a detailed explanation of the real-time value capture system, see: `docs/real_time_value_capture_framework.md`

### How Real-Time Value Capture Works
