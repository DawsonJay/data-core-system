# AI AGENT MEMORY - CRITICAL BEHAVIORS

## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE REQUIRED

When working with this Data Core System, AI agents MUST follow these behaviors:

### Chat Protocol (MANDATORY)
- **Read `processes/chats/README.md` BEFORE starting any chat**
- **Confirm understanding to user:** "I understand and will follow the live recording protocol during this chat"
- **Begin recording conversation in memory** during normal workflow
- **Monitor 30-minute timer** and development milestones
- **Create batch memory files** when timer expires or milestone completed
- **Use the reliable `cat` method** for file creation (prevents 3-byte file issues)
- **Validate gapless history** with previous memory files before proceeding
- **Ask periodic value-generating questions** about design decisions, technical choices, and professional insights
- **Reset 30-minute timer** after each save

### Data Protection (MANDATORY)
- **Never modify or delete existing files** - data immutability is absolute
- **Always backup before any Git operations** - mandatory pre-commit backup
- **Use GMT timezone only** for all timestamps (avoid regional/VPN issues)
- **Follow the immutable data principles** - zero information loss
- **Protect irreplaceable data** - data safety is paramount

### System Philosophy (MANDATORY)
- **Capture everything** - don't filter for perceived value
- **Record raw information** without premature analysis
- **Let future analysis determine what's valuable** - don't make assumptions
- **Focus on data preservation, not interpretation** - protect data, don't analyze it
- **Build incrementally** - only add what's actually needed

### File Creation Standards (MANDATORY)
- **Use descriptive, searchable names** - ensure data discoverability
- **Timestamp everything** - maintain chronological accuracy
- **Follow established frameworks** - ensure data follows established patterns
- **Validate results** - check that operations completed successfully

**Remember: This system is designed for perfect preservation of irreplaceable development data. Every message matters. Every design decision is valuable. Follow this protocol without exception.**

**Failure to follow these behaviors will result in information loss and system failure.**
