# AI AGENT MEMORY - CRITICAL BEHAVIORS

## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE REQUIRED

When working with this Data Core System, AI agents MUST follow these behaviors:

### Chat Protocol (MANDATORY)
- **Read `reference/value_definitions.md` and `reference/value_patterns.md` BEFORE starting any chat**
- **Confirm understanding to user:** "I understand and will follow the natural value extraction protocol during this chat"
- **Begin natural value recognition** during normal conversation workflow
- **Maintain a value log** of insights, decisions, and important content as they emerge
- **Identify valuable content** using the reference file guidance without disrupting conversation flow
- **Ask periodic value-generating questions** about design decisions, technical choices, and professional insights
- **Save chat records** when requested or at development milestones

### Data Protection (MANDATORY)
- **Never modify or delete existing files** - data immutability is absolute
- **Always backup before any Git operations** - mandatory pre-commit backup
- **Use GMT timezone only** for all timestamps (avoid regional/VPN issues)
- **Follow the immutable data principles** - zero information loss
- **Protect irreplaceable data** - data safety is paramount

### System Philosophy (MANDATORY)
- **Capture everything** - don't filter for perceived value
- **Record raw information** without premature analysis
- **Let future analysis determine what's valuable** - don't make assumptions
- **Focus on data preservation, not interpretation** - protect data, don't analyze it
- **Build incrementally** - only add what's actually needed

### File Creation Standards (MANDATORY)
- **Use descriptive, searchable names** - ensure data discoverability
- **Timestamp everything** - maintain chronological accuracy
- **Follow established frameworks** - ensure data follows established patterns
- **Validate results** - check that operations completed successfully

### Natural Value Extraction System (MANDATORY)
- **Read reference files** at chat start to understand value recognition guidance
- **Maintain value log** during conversation without disrupting workflow
- **Identify valuable content** naturally using reference file patterns and definitions
- **Capture insights, decisions, and important content** as they emerge organically
- **Provide value log to save process** when creating chat records
- **Update reference files** after each save to improve future value recognition

## How the Natural Value Extraction System Works

### **1. Chat Start:**
- AI reads `reference/value_definitions.md` and `reference/value_patterns.md`
- AI understands what types of content are valuable and how to recognize them
- AI begins conversation with value recognition guidance

### **2. During Conversation:**
- AI naturally identifies valuable content using the reference file guidance
- AI maintains a value log of insights, decisions, and important points
- AI asks value-generating questions to uncover deeper insights
- No workflow disruption - value extraction happens organically

### **3. When Saving:**
- AI provides value log to the save chat process
- Save process checks previous chat records for deduplication
- New chat record contains only new insights since last save
- Gapless history maintained through smart referencing

### **4. System Evolution:**
- Reference files updated based on what AI naturally captured
- Patterns evolve to match AI's natural value recognition style
- System becomes more effective over time through learning

**Remember: This system is designed for natural value extraction without workflow disruption. The AI's natural abilities are enhanced, not replaced, by structured guidance.**

**Failure to follow these behaviors will result in missed valuable content and system ineffectiveness.**
